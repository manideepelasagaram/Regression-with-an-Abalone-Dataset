# Predicting Abalone Age with Machine Learning

### Introduction

In this project, our objective is to develop machine learning models to predict the age of abalones based on various physical measurements. Abalones are a type of shellfish, and understanding their age is crucial for marine biology research and fisheries management. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to accurately estimate abalone age, which can inform sustainable harvesting practices and ecosystem conservation efforts.

## Data Exploration

### Creating DataFrame

We start by loading the Abalone dataset into a pandas DataFrame, omitting the redundant 'id' column to streamline our analysis.

### Dimensions of the DataFrame

Examining the dimensions of the DataFrame provides insights into its size and structure, guiding subsequent data processing steps.

### Displaying the First 20 Rows

Inspecting the first few rows of the DataFrame offers an initial glimpse into the dataset's content and format.

## Data Preprocessing

### Creating Dummies

To handle the categorical variable 'Sex', we employ one-hot encoding to transform it into dummy variables, simplifying model training.

### Data Partitioning

Partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets facilitates effective model training and evaluation, ensuring robust performance on unseen data.

## Modelling Techniques

###  CatBoost Regressor

Utilizing the CatBoost Regressor, we implement gradient boosting techniques to predict abalone age. Hyperparameter tuning optimizes model performance, with a focus on minimizing the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).

## Testing

### Predictions on Test Data

The trained CatBoost Regressor model is applied to the test dataset to generate predictions, providing valuable insights into abalone age estimation based on physical characteristics.

## Conclusion

In this project, we leverage advanced machine learning techniques to predict abalone age accurately. Through meticulous data preprocessing and model training, we achieve robust predictive performance, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in marine biology research and fisheries management.
